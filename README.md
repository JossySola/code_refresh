# Code Refresher
***

After 8 months of absence in the coding learning journey, I make this repository to `refresh my knowledge` in this matter.

Taking in consideration some `specific concepts & technologies`, I'm going to be practicing in this repository:

+ Git (_commands_)
+ Github (_pull requests & coding flow_)
+ Advanced JavaScript (_Classes, Modules, Objects_)
+ Testing (_Mocha & Chai_)
+ Async JavaScript and HTTP Requests
+ React & Redux (_probably going to practice in separate repositories_)
